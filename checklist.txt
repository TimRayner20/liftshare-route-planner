Required: 
✅ Create React App - Initialize core components 
✅ Initialize state management
✅ Implement Logic For Add Journey Form (geocoding service to get location latitude and longitude based on the origin/destination text entered => store in state )
✅ Implement Logic For Journey Schedule Form (datetime entry for departure/return => store in state)
✅ Implement Map => the map should render a blank message if no route is found. Once route has an origin location, render a map with marker(s)
✅ Implement route drawing from origin location to destination
✅ Plug in both forms into a multi-step form. 
✅ Render submit button if route details are complete 
✅ Fake XHR POST with route details as payload

Nice To Have (if you have time): 
❌ Implement address autocomplete in form 
❌ Implement distance counter below map 
❌ current location option on origin location in first form step 
❌ bespoke styling to make UI pop and UX as creative as possible. 


Bugs found during development:
✅ Origin / Destination and Departure / return time cannot be updated once returning back through the form. 
✅ map markers are extremely small - make clearer. 
✅ zoom level should depend on location of markers on map
